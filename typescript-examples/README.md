## Running the NodeJS Examples

These instructions assume you have NodeJS and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

**For each example directory:**

1.  **Navigate to the example directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `cd` command to navigate to the specific directory of the example you want to run. For example:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/example-directory
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will download and install all the required libraries for the example.

3.  **Obtain a Gemini API Key:**
    * Go to the Google AI Studio website: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
    * If you don't have one already, create a new API key.
    * **Keep this API key secure and do not share it publicly.**

4.  **Run the example:**
    Execute the development script defined in the `package.json` file. This is typically done with the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will likely start the NodeJS application.

5.  **Enter the Gemini API Key:**
    When the application starts, it will prompt you in the console to enter your Gemini API key. Carefully copy and paste your API key when requested and press Enter.

6.  **Interact with the example:**
    Follow the instructions or prompts displayed in the console to interact with the example application. The input and output will be handled through your terminal.

7.  **Refer to the README:**
    For more specific details about the example, its functionality, and any additional instructions, please refer to the `README.md` file located in the example's directory.
